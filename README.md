# BackTab Navigator

BackTab Navigator is a Chrome extension that allows you to open links in background tabs without switching to them. This extension is perfect for users who want to enhance their browsing efficiency and multitasking capabilities.

## Features

- Open links in background tabs with a left-click
- New tabs open next to the current tab, not at the end
- Three modes of operation:
  1. All Domains: Functionality applies to all domains
  2. Specific Domains: Functionality only applies to user-defined domains
  3. Off: Extension is disabled
- Easy-to-use popup interface for managing settings and domain list
- Mode changes apply immediately to all open tabs
- Usage tracking for potential future features
- Shift-click override: Holding the Shift key while clicking a link will open the link normally, without the extension's functionality

## Ideal Use Cases

2. Research and Reading: Quickly open multiple articles or resources in background tabs while staying on your main search results page, allowing for more efficient information gathering.

3. Shopping Comparison: When comparing products across different websites, you can open multiple product pages in the background without losing your place on the main shopping page.

1. Right-click on the extension icon
2. Select "Inspect popup"
3. In the developer tools window that opens, switch to the "Console" tab
