## Monetization Suggestions

Here are some ideas for monetizing BackTab Navigator using a freemium model:

1. Free Tier:
   - Basic functionality (current features)
   - Limited number of specific websites (e.g., up to 5)

2. Premium Tier:
   - Unlimited specific websites
   - Custom keyboard shortcuts
   - Sync settings across devices
   - Priority support

3. Enterprise Tier:
   - All Premium features
   - Team management dashboard
   - Usage analytics
   - Customizable deployment options

Alternative monetization methods:
- Donation-based: Keep the extension free and open-source, but add a donation button for users who want to support development.
- Pay-what-you-want: Allow users to choose their own price for the premium version.

Consider starting with a donation model to build a user base, then introduce premium features based on user feedback and usage data.
